      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>I built Viridian as a free app. This Service is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
      <p>If you choose to use my Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for research and improvements to the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions regarding this policy, please <a href="mailto:green@viridian.eco">contact me.</a></p>
      <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
      <p>We collect aggregate data of how users interact with Viridian, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>which activities are logged and when,</li>
        <li>device metadata (model, OS version, app version, language, region, carrier), and</li>
        <li>other data regarding usage patterns (which pages are most commonly viewed, session lengths, number of sessions).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Viridian uses Amplitude to track app usage. You can check out Amplitudeâ€™s privacy policy at <br><a href="https://amplitude.com/privacy">https://amplitude.com/privacy</a>.</p>
      <p>Data collected will be used solely by the developers to determine how to improve Viridian and further our mission of making sustainability accessible to everyone. <b>We will not sell your data.</b></p>
      <h3>Service Providers</h3>
      <p>I may employ third-party companies and/or individuals for any of the following reasons:</p>

      <p>I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on my behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>No method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable. I strive for, but cannot guarantee, the absolute security of your data.</p>
