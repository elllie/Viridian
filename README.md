Your carbon footprint is not limited to the number of miles you drive or the amount of electricity you use. Viridian lets you track your activities spanning all areas of life, then tells you exactly what impact you're making--and gives you personalized ways to improve your contribution.

### Track your carbon footprint

Sustainability is a mindfulness game, and it's easy to wonder if the little everyday things even make a difference. Every time you take an action to promote environmentalism, no matter how small, log it and Viridian will automatically keep the tallies. Your activities quickly add up.

### Live your greenest life

Viridian learns what you're good at and displays personalized tips and achievements to help make it easier for you to reduce your carbon impact on an individual level.
